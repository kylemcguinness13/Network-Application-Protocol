# Network-Application-Protocol
To run this Network Application Protocol, you must first set the Host variable on line 5 of both Server.py and Client.py to the IP address of the device you wish to host the server. Then make sure to assign the Port variable in both Server.py and Client.py on line 6 to an open port on the machine hosting the server. Once the port number and host address have been set, run one instance of the Server.py and as many instances of Client.py as you would like. Send messages from one client thread to the rest of the client threads by typing a message in the terminal and pressing enter to send the message.
